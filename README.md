this is a simple dev stack for using tailwindcss 2.1 with JITZ compilation ,
I added configs bor tailwindcss , via postcss and a live reload dev server 
just

then :

A script to compile twailwindcss with postcss

> yarn dev 

and to have a live reload local dev server for better and faster deb experience 

>yarn serve 

Change the Taiwind css classes in /build/index.html to see in action
